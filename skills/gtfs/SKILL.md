description: Validate a GTFS Schedule feed (a GTFS ZIP file, a local path, or a public feed URL) with the GTFS Analyzer engine and explain publishability, scores, and the highest-priority fixes. Use when the user asks to validate, check, or analyze a GTFS feed or transit timetable ZIP, asks what a GTFS rule ID means, or types /gtfs.

# GTFS Validator

Validate the feed with the GTFS Analyzer engine and explain its result. The engine is the
only source of findings: never invent notices, recompute scores, or override its verdict.
Never send the feed anywhere; the analysis runs locally.

## 1. Get the feed

- **An attached ZIP or a local path**: use that file.
- **A public URL**: download it once to a local file, for example
  `curl -fL --max-time 120 -o feed.zip "<url>"`. In the chat's code sandbox, outbound requests
  to most sites are blocked (the download fails with a proxy error or HTTP 403). If the download
  fails for that reason, do not look for a workaround: ask the user to download the ZIP and
  attach it to the conversation.
- **Nothing given**: ask for a GTFS ZIP, or a public feed URL when running on the user's computer.

## 2. Make sure the engine is installed

Run `python3 -c "import gtfs_analyzer; print(gtfs_analyzer.__version__)"`. If that fails or
prints a version other than 0.16.0, install the pinned version:

```
pip install gtfs-analyzer==0.16.0
```

If pip refuses with "externally-managed-environment": in the chat's code sandbox, add
`--break-system-packages`; on the user's own computer, create a virtual environment instead
(`python3 -m venv ~/.cache/gtfs-validator/venv`) and use its `python` for the install and the
analysis. Never install into the user's system Python with `--break-system-packages`.

Ready-made packages exist for Linux x86_64, macOS on Apple silicon, and Windows x86_64. On other
platforms, such as an Intel Mac or Linux on ARM, pip falls back to building from source, which
needs a Rust toolchain. Do not attempt that build. Tell the user and point them to the browser
version at https://ttezer.github.io/gtfs-analyzer/, which runs the same engine on their device.
Do the same if PyPI cannot be reached.

## 3. Run the analysis

```
python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/analyze.py <feed.zip> --lang <en|tr|fr|ja>
```

If `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}` is not replaced, use `scripts/analyze.py` relative to this file.

**Language**: pass the user's language when it is English, Turkish, French, or Japanese. For any
other language pass `en`, then write your explanation in the user's language; keep rule IDs as
they are.

The script prints one JSON object; read it, not the raw engine output. Large feeds take longer
(a 7 MB feed with 200,000 findings takes a few seconds), but the summary stays small.

| Exit code | `error` | Meaning and what to do |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | — | Summary printed. Explain it (step 4). |
| 2 | `FATAL` | The engine could not open or read the feed, for example a corrupt ZIP. Report it as an analysis failure, not as a verdict on the feed, and quote `message`. |
| 3 | `PACKAGE_MISSING` | Go back to step 2. |
| 4 | `INPUT` | Bad argument or unreadable path. Fix the call and run again. |

## 4. Explain the result

Report, in this order:

1. **Publishability**: `publishability.publishable` as returned. If it is false, list the
   `blockers`. Do not call a feed unpublishable because of other notices, and do not call it
   publishable when the engine says it is not.
2. **Scores**: `scores` (overall, pub, spec, interop, quality, analytics) exactly as returned.
3. **Feed at a glance**: stop, route, and trip counts and the service window from `metrics`.
4. **What to fix first**: `r9_priorities` in the given order. For each, give the rule ID, title,
   how many instances, the remediation, and one concrete example (file, line, values).
5. **Totals**: `severity_counts` and `total_notices`. ANALYTICS and QUALITY findings describe the
   feed; they do not make it invalid by themselves.

If `validation_status` is `PARTIAL`, say first that coverage is incomplete, list
`partial.unavailable_files`, and explain that checks depending on them did not run. If
`version_warning` is present, mention which engine version produced the result.

Keep it short: a table for the scores, one or two lines per priority, and the remaining
priorities summarized in a sentence. Offer to run the analysis again on a corrected file.

### Example

> **Publishable: yes.** No blocking issues. One critical timing error should still be fixed.
>
> | Overall | Pub | Spec | Interop | Quality | Analytics |
> |---|---|---|---|---|---|
> | 95.9 | 100.0 | 100.0 | 92.6 | 92.6 | 96.2 |
>
> 4 stops, 1 route, 2 trips; service 2026-10-01 to 2026-12-31.
>
> **Fix first**
> 1. **STM_008**: stop times go backwards (critical, 1 instance). `stop_times.txt` line 4, trip
>    T1: arrival at S3 is 08:05:00, after 08:10:00 at S2. Times must increase along a trip.
> 2. **STP_022**: `stop_code` is missing for all 4 stops (medium). Add short codes riders know.
>
> 23 findings in total: 1 critical, 1 high, 3 medium, 2 low, 16 info.

## Rule questions

When the user asks what a rule ID means (for example `/gtfs TRP_002`):

1. If a result you already have contains the rule, answer from its `title`, `remediation`, and
   examples.
2. Otherwise look the rule up in the rule list for engine 0.16.0, in the user's language
   (`references/rules.<en|tr|fr|ja>.md`; `en` for other languages). Do not read the whole file;
   search for the row, matching the ID exactly:

   ```
   grep -F "| TRP_002 |" ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/rules.en.md
   ```

   The row gives the title, severity, and class. The `##` heading above it names the rule group.
   The list has no remediation text: explain what the title means for the feed and say that the
   exact fix and affected rows come from analyzing a feed.
3. If the ID is not in the list, say that the engine has no such rule. Do not guess one.
